## Lecture 4: The data visualisation process
>*Data visualization is an umbrella term to coverall types of visual representations that support the exploration, examination,and communication of data* - Steven Few

Two general types of data viz:
- **exploratory**:
  - trends and patterns
  - iterative
  - builds up understanding
- **explanatory**
  - later stages of research
  - aim: presentation
  - polished, free from detail
  - conveys a message: storytelling

Usages of data viz vary more:
- **analysis** (exploratory)
  - hard to give examples of, as it's a process, usually before publication. It gives an impression, invites to further exploration. Like this one:
    ![example](https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20240427_DAC402.jpg)
- **communication** (a conclusion, with a direction or decision)
    ![example](https://infobeautiful4.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/03/IIB-Ukraine-Russia-Year02-IIB-1276@2x-3.png)
- **monitoring**: Real-time visualization of financial market transactions, or road and weather conditions

- **planning**: seasonal variations in the number of tourists visiting a city may be useful for allocating resources effectively.

For discussion activity:

This is a treemap graph I found while browsing The Economist's "graphic detail". It jumped out because of it's compelling message. It is so incredibly simple yet still blew me away as the proportions are just mindboggling.   
![a good one](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20240406_WOT339.png)

For a bad one I ended up googleing bad data visualisations, and because I didn't want to seem uncritical to the Economist's (otherwise) data journalism I want to show this example of a truncated scale showing the Facebook popularity of one individual (a politician) in the context of the popularity of his party and the other figures in it. Framing him with a truncated scale reduced the strength of the key message.

#### key objectives:
Kirk specifies four key objectives (which I shall explore further in my studies over the coming months). 
1. Combine form and function, 2. strive for efficiency and effectiveness in the information exchange, 3. strip back clutter to increase intuitiveness, and 4. observe ethical standards and respect your reader. 
**Strive for form and function**
- Fundamentally, attractive form enhances function
- try to achieve the foundation of something that informs—that functions—before exploring the ways of enhancing its form. 

**Justifying the selection of everything we do**
every visible property presented is used to communicate data, whether it be the use of color, the arc lengths of the petals, the position and sequence of stems; nothing is redundant and everything is deliberate.
strive for efficiency and effectiveness in the information exchange

**Creating accessibility through intuitive design**
- Overload, clutter, and confusion are not attributes of information

**Never deceive the receiver**
- Obeying visualization ethics is clearly an objective for any project, but really it is just
about basic, good practice, respect for your readers, and attention to detail.
