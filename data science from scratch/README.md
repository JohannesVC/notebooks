The content in this folder is based on a reading of `Data Science From Scratch: First Principles with Python` by Joel Grus.

The book didn't use any libraries. See the Notes and the original repo folder.

In the top folder you can find a series of projects with common machine learning libraries. 

These are tutorials, Kaggle competitions, etc.
