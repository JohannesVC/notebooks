  'Definition': 'Number of unique smallholder farmer individuals who were clients during the reporting period.',

  'Usage Guidance': "This metric is intended to capture the number of unique smallholder farmer clients who received the organization's products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of client transactions. For example, a smallholder farmer customer who makes two purchases during a period should only be counted once. Organizations wishing to report on client purchases should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).\n\nSince this metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals serviced, organizations should not apply any household multipliers to their reports against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.\n\nOrganizations that rely on assumptions to report against this metric, including in the process for determining the number of client individuals, should footnote all assumptions used in their calculation process.\n\nFor healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.",

By selling to the organization, farmers get USD 2 per pound for a good (such as apples) compared to only USD 1 per pound for selling the same good in the local market.

  'Metric Name': 'Average Agricultural Yield',
  'Definition': "Evaluates average agricultural yield per hectare of the set implied by another metric. For example, this metric applied to Client Individuals (PI4060) would yield the average agricultural yield of the organization's (farmer) clients. Organizations should calculate this metric for each individual agricultural product. See usage guidance for further information.",
  'Footnote': 'Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including method for gathering yield data ((e.g., survey to a sample set of clients, survey to all clients).',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric, applied to another metric, is intended to evaluate the average agricultural yield of the set implied by the other metric. Organizations can average actual yield data or survey a representative sample. For example, if evaluating average agricultural yield of client farmers using Client Individuals (PI4060), organizations could average actual yield data per farmer or survey representative individual farmers.\n\nOrganizations should report yield separately for each agricultural product, reporting the relevant product with Crop Type (PD1620) or Livestock/Fish Type (PD4686), as appropriate. Organizations should also report yield from the most recent harvest and footnote details on the unit of measure per hectare (such as kilograms or bushels) using Unit of Measure (PD1602).\n\nThis metric could be valuable for organizations that sell inputs (such as fertilizer or irrigation equipment) to farmers that help improve yields. \n\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',

Species are categorized in these databases according to their degree of extinction, which suggests a corresponding prioritization of conservation measures for species and their habitats. If reported, organizations should use the common name of each included species. Organizations can compare and verify their categorizations against the lists of the authority they reference. Specialized biodiversity measurement approaches such as IUCN’s STAR can identify which impacts threaten species the most.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Conservation Priority Characteristics (PD9009) and Biodiversity Assessment (OI5929).",

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the number of unique child and adolescent clients who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).\n\nOrganizations operating in health services may find it beneficial to report with greater specificity the ages of their clients. For best practice guidelines for youth classification, see the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013/intro/keyterms/en/), which defines age ranges as follows: infant (birth to one year), child (one to 10 years), and adolescent (10 to 19 years). \n\nThis metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.\n\nMany organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold.

For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization.

Organizations wishing to report total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184) and related submetrics. Organizations wishing to report the number of unique clients during the course of the reporting period can report on Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.\n\nFor financial institutions (including microfinance institutions), this metric would include the number of individuals who currently have outstanding loan balances with the organization. For those financial institutions offering deposit products, this metric would include the number of individuals who have active deposit accounts with the organization. For those financial institutions offering insurance products, this metric would include those with active insurance policies. In all cases, the reported number should be based on the number of individuals, rather than the number of groups or number of active policies/accounts.\n\nThe definition of active may vary by offering. For example, for traditional financial services, “active” may include all individuals who have accounts registered in their names for at least six months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior six months. For digital financial services, “active” may include individuals who have had accounts registered in their names for at least three months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior three months.\n\nThis metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric.

This metric may be reported in conjunction with Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.\n\nOrganizations that provide products and services that are used by an entire household (such as clean cookstoves or home weatherization) might find it more appropriate to report on the number of client households served rather than the number of client individuals. By multiplying the number of Client Households by Client Household Size, organizations can estimate the number of individuals served. For example, an organization that sells products to 100 Client Households with a Client Household Size of 5 could estimate that they served 500 individuals.\n\nOrganizations that rely on assumptions to report against this metric should footnote all assumptions used in the calculation. Organizations can refer to the following sources for additional information on determining client household sizes, in addition to national census information:\n- United Nations, Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses (Revision 3) (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/Standards-and-Methods/files/Principles_and_Recommendations/Population-and-Housing-Censuses/Series_M67rev3-E.pdf)  \n- Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (http://sedlac.econo.unlp.edu.ar/eng/statistics-detalle.php?idE=36)",

  'JII Guidance': 'Full-time Employees: Female Managers (OI1571) is required for Joint Impact Indicator: Number of Women in Senior Management.\n\nJII definition: Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) female employees in senior management roles working for the client company or project at the end of the reporting period. Senior management is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management (usually executive level positions) who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They are often referred to as the “C-suite” and include positions such as Chief Executive Officer – CEO; Chief Financial Officer – CFO; Chief Marketing Officer – CMO; Chief Operations Officer – COO; Chief Information Officer – CIO; Chief Legal Counsel – CLC, etc. Within different corporations, they can also sometimes be referred to as executive management, top management, or upper management. \n\nJII guidance: This metric is intended to capture female representation in Senior Management. Practitioners will need to collect "Total Number of Senior Managers" to get a percentage. Female Senior Managers may also hold ownership stakes or Board or Investment Committee positions in the organization. As such, Practitioners should avoid double-counting women who fill multiple roles within an organization by not aggregating HIPSO\'s "Number of Women in Senior Management" with "Number of Women on the Board", "Number of Investment Committee members who are female", or "Female Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance)". Practitioners may also refer to sector-specific gender leadership benchmarks and application guidance as needed, such as those specified by the 2X Challenge (www.2xchallenge.org). \n\nJII applicability: All client companies, where relevant. Practitioners may use the metric for investment fund investees, where relevant, but typically not used for clients of other intermediated finance (e.g. commercial banks).',

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the organization’s theory of change. A theory of change (also referred to as a Theory of Value Creation or Logic Model) expresses the sequence of cause-and-effect actions or occurrences by which organizational and financial resources are hypothesized to convert into the desired social and environmental results. It provides a conceptual roadmap for how an organization expects to achieve its intended impact. Often displayed in a diagram, many theories of change can be expressed as a series of if–then statements, specifying what the organization does and the expected results of each activity. A framework built around the concepts of activities, inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts is called a Logic Model or Impact Value Chain. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information and resources.\n\nWherever possible, organizations’ theories of change should refer to relevant IRIS metrics.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to footnote information on the defined outcomes they seek to achieve for their targeted stakeholders (e.g., clients, employees, distributors, suppliers, and/or the environment). Defined outcomes include specific targets that can be measured. Many are based on existing literature. Organizations are encouraged to footnote information on the evidence base that substantiates the logic chain linking outputs to defined outcomes. This evidence base might include credible secondary research, randomized control trials (RCT), longitudinal studies, primary research (such as customer surveys or stakeholder feedback forums), and qualitative interviews or case studies.\n\nFor example, an organization that provides training to and sources from smallholder farmers might only report on the number of farmers trained (Individuals Trained: Total [PI2998]), the number of smallholder farmers sourced from (Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI9991]), and the total payments made to those farmers (Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI7852]). However, its theory of change might describe how these outputs lead to outcomes, such as helping farmers build larger and more productive farms, and impacts, such as improved livelihoods, pointing to external research that supports this connection.',

For instance, the example organization above that buys mangoes might also report Supplier Individuals: Smallholder (PI9991) and Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder (PI7852).\n\nOrganizations are also encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Relationship to Target Stakeholders (OD7900).\n\nFor planet-related stakeholders, organizations are encouraged to use this metric in conjunction with Target Stakeholder Ecoregion (PD2854), Target Stakeholder Setting (PD6384), Target Area Protected Status (PD1676), and Target Stakeholder Geography (PD6424).\n\nThis metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome.

Community engagement strategies involve intentional approaches to align the development priorities of local communities with the goals of the organization.\n\nExamples of strategy elements, to footnote, may include: providing deliberate resources (e.g., employee time and skills, in-kind giving, leadership) to community organizations or individuals, providing education and skills training, creating opportunities for employee volunteering and fundraising, contracting to local suppliers, lobbying to strengthen local issues, facilitating discussions with local leaders, integrating the company's community engagement activities into organizational functions, creating institutional policies and incentives for community engagement, and measuring the social impact of the organization's community engagement activities.\n\nThe strategy may also dictate methods (e.g., memoranda of understanding) for considering, informing, and consulting with existing community groups before implementing organizational activities that affect the community. For example, organizations may assess and take into account existing formal, informal, and historic land-use rights of local communities or Indigenous peoples prior to operations that affect the land.\n\nHistorical land titles offer one way to evaluate which communities to engage. LandMark (http://www.landmarkmap.org/) provides data on Indigenous and community land rights. In engaging the community, organizations should use a consent process to ensure that the entire community endorses the project and not just a few elite members.\n\nBiodiversity conservation projects will often require involving traditional landowners or others from the community who rely on the land.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the following sources for further guidance on community engagement strategies:\n\n- Community Planning Toolkit (http://www.communityplanningtoolkit.org/sites/default/files/Engagement0815.pdf)\n- International Finance Corporation's Strategic Community Investment: A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-ifc/publications/publications_handbook_communityinvestment__wci__1319576907570)\n- The Conference Board's The Civic 50: Best Practices in Corporate Community Engagement (https://conference-board.org/publications/Civic-50-Corporate-Communication-Practices)\n- World Bank's Community Engagement Planning Tool (http://wbi.worldbank.org/sske/resource-library/community-engagement-planning-tool)\n- World Bank's Participation Sourcebook (http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1996/02/696745/world-bank-participation-sourcebook)",

A board of directors is the governing body of a corporation, composed of a group of individuals that is legally/fiduciarily responsible for overseeing the organization’s management and operations and guiding its strategy. The board is accountable to the shareholders and other relevant stakeholders. A governing body with a different name (e.g., "advisory body") may be considered a Board of Directors provided it has a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders and/or other relevant stakeholders. \n\nJII guidance: This metric is intended to capture female representation within the board of directors, supervisory board, or governing body of an organization. Practitioners will need to collect "Total Number of Board Members" to get a percentage. Female Board Members may also hold ownership stakes, Senior Management positions, or Investment Committee positions in the organization. For Financial Intermediaries, the metric refers to the Female Board Members of the Financial Intermediary. For Equity Funds, the metric refers to the Female Board Members of the General Partner. For Investment Fund Investees, also refer to the HIPSO metric "Number of Female Founded Enterprises." Practitioners should avoid double-counting women who fill multiple roles within an organization by not aggregating HIPSO\'s "Number of Women on the Board" with "Number of Women in Senior Management," "Number of Investment Committee members who are female," or "Female Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance)." Practitioners may also refer to specific gender leadership benchmarks and application guidance as needed, such as those specified by the 2X Challenge (www.2xchallenge.org).\n\nJII applicability: All client companies, where relevant. Practitioners may use this metric for investment fund investees, where applicable, but typically not used for clients of other intermediated finance (e.g. commercial banks).',

  'Usage Guidance': "This metric is intended to capture the number of strikes and lockouts occurring among the organization's employees during the reporting period. Strikes and lockouts sometimes represent a breakdown in labor–management relations and a suspension of consultative processes. Data regarding the occurrence of such industrial incidents can usefully convey the state of labor–management relations and the direction of its progression over time. Strikes and lockouts must be set in the context of any limitations of local legislation and benchmarked against norms for inter-country, inter-industry, and inter-category comparisons. As employees take greater freedom in questioning their rights and respect in the workplace, organizations may observe strikes and lockouts increasing. As policies begin to take hold and change is effected, strikes and lockouts may then decrease.\n\nAn employee strike is a work stoppage caused by one or several of the following voluntary actions by a number of employees: reducing the normal performance of their employment, breaking their employment agreements, refusing or failing to accept engagement for work in which they are usually employed, reducing their normal output, or reducing their normal rate of work. A strike usually happens in response to employee grievances.\n\nA lockout, also a work stoppage, is a temporary denial of employment initiated by the employer. Lockouts sometimes occur as a bargaining tactic by the employer in response to an employee strike.",

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the socioeconomic details of the target stakeholders of the organization\'s activities. Organizations can benefit people and the planet throughout their supply and distribution chains, by providing products or services, and through their operations.\n\n"Lower income" is defined according to a consumption-based approach to measuring poverty, specifically including individuals or households living below a recognized poverty line that establishes the minimum available expenditure that would meet a household’s basic needs. Organizations should prefer to define this threshold based on a national poverty line set by the national government. If such a benchmark is unavailable, organizations can use the international USD 3.20 per person per day expenditure at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), as defined by the World Bank. In either case, organizations should footnote their definition of the poverty threshold and its source.\n\n"Lower middle-income" and "Upper middle-income" thresholds are defined per capita by the World Bank each year in PPP-adjusted current dollars (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mic/overview#1). Organizations should footnote the threshold used, the PPP adjustment applied, and any household size assumptions, if applicable.\n\nIf selecting the option "Other," organizations are encouraged to align to an existing, generally accepted standard or classification of the target socioeconomic group. If doing so, organizations should footnote the classification or standard used. \n\nThis metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',

  'Footnote': 'Organizations should footnote further details about the types of stakeholder(s) they target.',
  'Usage Guidance': "This metric is intended to capture the basic demographic groups of target stakeholders of an organization's products, services, and operations. A target stakeholder can be a client, employee, or anyone the organization is aiming to positively impact. Some organizations call a target stakeholder a ‘beneficiary.’\n\nTarget stakeholders—whether clients, employees, or others—should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.  \n\n\nThe categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.\n\nThis metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.",

Refer to each metric's usage guidance for details.\n\nJII definition: Number of enterprises in which there is an active female founder(s). Female founder(s) must retain an active role in the organization as of the end of the reporting period. An active role may include acting in an advisory capacity for key decisions and does not necessarily require a full-time role at the organization.\n\nJII guidance: Practitioners may refer to specific gender benchmarks and application guidance as needed, such as those specified by the 2X Challenge (www.2xchallenge.org).\n\nJII applicability: Direct Equity client, General Partner of a Debt or Equity Fund client, and investment fund investees. For investment fund investees, refer to guidance for “Number of Active Fund Investments in Female Founded Enterprises” and “Number of Realized Fund Investments in Female Founded Enterprises”.\n\nJII Guidance for Female Direct Employment Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance): \n\nAlignment comments: Alignment to the JII indicator requires using IRIS metrics Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874), Jobs Type (OD0660), and Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752).

For example, a company that develops mobile software to inform rural farmers of real time market price data changes operates in the ICT category, but targets or influences the Agriculture sector.

This includes individuals hired directly and individuals hired through third party agencies, as long as those individuals provide services related to the operations and maintenance of the client company or investment project. This also includes full-time equivalent worked by seasonal, contractual and part-time workers.\n\nJII guidance: \nFTE Calculation for Direct Jobs: Temporary workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on the average number of months worked over the total months in the reporting period (e.g., if worker worked for three months, this would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). Seasonal or short-term jobs are prorated on the basis of the portion of the reporting period that was worked (e.g., a full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). If the information is not available, the rule-of-thumb is two part-time jobs equal a full-time job. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider headcount of number of workers paid piece-rate and an estimate of what proportion of FTE that category of workers are used for (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). \nSimilarly, where there are a large number of workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, please include average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), and the proportion of the year those workers are working for (e.g., 3 shifts of 100 people each day for the whole year: FTE = 3 x 100 x 12/12 = 300). If a temporary worker is part time, the calculation should be number of workers times proportion of a full working week times proportion of a year worked (e.g., FTE = 100 x 3/5 x 6/12 = 30)\nFull time Equivalent (FTE): Part-time jobs for construction workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). Full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year. \nDirect Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance): In order to fully capture all direct jobs, consider these: \n(a) Senior Management: Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in senior management roles working for the client company or project at the end of the reporting period. Senior management is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management (usually executive level positions) who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They are often referred to as the “C-suite” and include positions such as Chief Executive Officer – CEO; Chief Financial Officer – CFO; Chief Marketing Officer – CMO; Chief Operations Officer – COO; Chief Information Officer – CIO; Chief Legal Counsel – CLC, etc. Within different corporations, they can also sometimes be referred to as executive management, top management, or upper management. \n(b) Permanent full time direct jobs (not including management): Please report number of workers at the end of the reporting period. FTE = headcount for this category of workers. These are generally workers on the payroll. \n(c) Permanent part time direct jobs (not including management): This includes workers converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). These are part time workers on the payroll, including those working variable hours. If the average proportion of full-time figure is not known, 0.5 can be used as an estimate. \n(d)Temporary direct jobs: All workers paid directly by the company, but engaged only for a specific period of time, including fixed-term, project- or task-based contracts, as well as seasonal or casual work, including day labor. It includes those on written and verbal contracts, performing work on or off-site, associated with the operations and maintenance of the business. If the number of temporary workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done based on the number of workers at the end of the reporting period (converting headcount to FTE for any workers who are part time, see below). If there is significant variation during the year, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period as follows. \n(e) Insourced / contracted jobs: This includes all workers performing duties associated with the core business processes of the business (core business processes constitute those production and/or service processes essential for a specific business activity without which the business activity could not continue) on or off site, paid via a third party. It includes, for example, security guards employed by a contractor and workers employed via agencies or labor brokers, etc. \nIf the number of workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done at the end of the reporting period. If there is significant variation, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period using guidance above on calculating FTE for temporary workers. \nEXCLUSIONS. \nPlatform Jobs: If a company facilitates the trading of goods or services between two parties, but does not itself purchase those goods or services, the jobs created or sustained by that facilitation should not be included in Direct Jobs. For example, a platform company that facilitates customers accessing services from individuals, where the customer pays the individual providing the service, even where payment is done via the platform. The jobs within the company that facilitates the exchange (e.g., software programmers), or contractors paid by the company, should be counted under direct or contracted jobs, respectively. Construction Jobs: Only include construction jobs if the company is itself a construction or real estate company, and the jobs are therefore not expected to cease at the end of the construction phase of any individual asset. Construction jobs supported during the construction of a company’s assets are not included in this metric. All jobs associated with timebound construction projects should be captured under the metric: Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction). \n\nJII Guidance for Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction): \n\nAlignment comments: Alignment to the JII indicator requires using IRIS metrics Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) and Jobs Type (OD0660). Refer to each metric's usage guidance for details.\n\nJII definition: Number of temporary full-time equivalent workers hired for the construction of the investment project’s hard assets during the reporting period.\n\nJII guidance: \nFTE Calculation for Direct Jobs: Temporary workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on the average number of months worked over the total months in the reporting period (e.g., if worker worked for three months, this would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). \nSeasonal or short-term jobs are prorated on the basis of the portion of the reporting period that was worked (e.g., a full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). If the information is not available, the rule-of-thumb is two part-time jobs equal a full-time job.\nWhere companies employ piece-rate workers, consider headcount of number of workers paid piece-rate and an estimate of what proportion of FTE that category of workers are used for (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). \nSimilarly, where there are a large number of workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, please include average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), and the proportion of the year those workers are working for (e.g., 3 shifts of 100 people each day for the whole year: FTE = 3 x 100 x 12/12 = 300). If a temporary worker is part time, the calculation should be number of workers times proportion of a full working week times proportion of a year worked (e.g., FTE = 100 x 3/5 x 6/12 = 30)\nFull time Equivalent (FTE): Part-time jobs for construction workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). Full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year. \nConstruction Jobs (Temporary Construction): This indicator includes all workers involved in the construction of the company’s assets, including those employed by third parties if they are working on-site.\nTemporary means the jobs will cease when construction of the asset is completed and may include multi-year contracts for large assets.\nConstruction Companies: This metric does not include workers of construction companies where the client itself is a construction or real estate company. These workers are counted under the Direct Jobs Supported (operations and maintenance) metric.\n\nJII Guidance for Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance): \n\nAlignment comments: Alignment to the JII indicator requires using IRIS metrics Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) and Jobs Type (OD0660). Refer to each metric's usage guidance for details.\n\nJII definition: Number of new full-time equivalent workers, as per local definition, that are hired as a direct consequence of the investment project implementation during the reporting period (see guidance). This includes individuals hired directly and individuals hired through third party agencies, as long as those individuals provide services related to the operations and maintenance of the investment project. This also includes new full-time equivalent work by seasonal, contractual and part-time workers. Existing workers on the records of the client company prior to the investment project are not to be included in this indicator, except where the base case establishes that existing jobs are terminating without the investment project.",

  'Footnote': 'Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including how they identify low-income areas. Organizations that report data for more than one reporting period should be careful to very clearly footnote which they are using for this metric. See usage guidance for further information.',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations and in low-income areas during the reporting period.\n\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.”\n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on defining low-income areas. \n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.\n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\n\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

Organizations should include only those clients who were placed in and began jobs during the reporting period. They should exclude clients who were placed in jobs but did not begin work.\n\nOrganizations are also encouraged to provide details on the types of activities they conducted to increase job placement rates, such as (but not limited to): monitoring workforce trends to ensure alignment between program offerings and workforce needs, surveying employers (to capture position offerings, skills needed, and likely wages), strengthening relationships with potential employers, providing resources (such as interview tips, career fairs, and job leads) to assist job searches and career development, and creating program alumni networks.\n\nIn the case of employees assisted to find jobs, organizations may use total employees assisted as the denominator in this formula, calculated as: Permanent Employees: Total (OI8869) + Temporary Employees (OI9028), disaggregated into the number of employees using the job-placement benefit specified by Employment Benefits (OI2742).\n\nFor work integrating social enterprises (WISE), a high job placement rate is an indicator of success.

  'Definition': 'Net number of new, full-time equivalent employees working for enterprises financed or supported by the organization during the reporting period.\n\nMany organizations select the beginning of the reporting period as the time when the organization began its support or investment.',

  'Calculation': '= Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) – Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691)',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations during the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \n\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.” \n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

  'Metric Name': 'Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises',
  'Definition': 'Number of full-time equivalent employees working for enterprises financed or supported by the organization as of the end of the reporting period.',
  'Footnote': 'Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. See usage guidance for further information.',
  'Calculation': ' = Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) + Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687)',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs at all financed or directly supported enterprises as of the end of the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \n\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party and directly related to operations and maintenance of company.” To align to the HIPSO indicator Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction), organizations should include only the data for Jobs Type (OD0660) options “Permanence: Temporary (One-Time)” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party, but not directly related to operations and maintenance of company.”\n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \n\nThis metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

Refer to each metric's usage guidance for details.\n\nJII definition: Number of full-time equivalent workers, as per local definition, working for the client company or investment project at the end of the reporting period unless there is seasonal variation (see guidance). \nThis includes individuals hired directly and individuals hired through third party agencies, as long as those individuals provide services related to the operations and maintenance of the client company or investment project. This also includes full-time equivalent worked by seasonal, contractual and part-time workers.\n\nJII guidance: \nFTE Calculation for Direct Jobs: Temporary workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on the average number of months worked over the total months in the reporting period (e.g., if worker worked for three months, this would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). \nSeasonal or short-term jobs are prorated on the basis of the portion of the reporting period that was worked (e.g., a full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). If the information is not available, the rule-of-thumb is two part-time jobs equal a full-time job.\nWhere companies employ piece-rate workers, consider headcount of number of workers paid piece-rate and an estimate of what proportion of FTE that category of workers are used for (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). \nSimilarly, where there are a large number of workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, please include average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), and the proportion of the year those workers are working for (e.g., 3 shifts of 100 people each day for the whole year: FTE = 3 x 100 x 12/12 = 300). If a temporary worker is part time, the calculation should be number of workers times proportion of a full working week times proportion of a year worked (e.g., FTE = 100 x 3/5 x 6/12 = 30)\nFull time Equivalent (FTE): Part-time jobs for construction workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). Full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year. \nDirect Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance): In order to fully capture all direct jobs, consider these: \n(a) Senior Management: Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in senior management roles working for the client company or project at the end of the reporting period. Senior management is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management (usually executive level positions) who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They are often referred to as the “C-suite” and include positions such as Chief Executive Officer – CEO; Chief Financial Officer – CFO; Chief Marketing Officer – CMO; Chief Operations Officer – COO; Chief Information Officer – CIO; Chief Legal Counsel – CLC, etc. Within different corporations, they can also sometimes be referred to as executive management, top management, or upper management. \n(b) Permanent full time direct jobs (not including management): Please report number of workers at the end of the reporting period. FTE = headcount for this category of workers. These are generally workers on the payroll. \n(c) Permanent part time direct jobs (not including management): This includes workers converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). These are part time workers on the payroll, including those working variable hours. If the average proportion of full-time figure is not known, 0.5 can be used as an estimate. \n(d)Temporary direct jobs: All workers paid directly by the company, but engaged only for a specific period of time, including fixed-term, project- or task-based contracts, as well as seasonal or casual work, including day labor. It includes those on written and verbal contracts, performing work on or off-site, associated with the operations and maintenance of the business. If the number of temporary workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done based on the number of workers at the end of the reporting period (converting headcount to FTE for any workers who are part time, see below). If there is significant variation during the year, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period as follows. \n(e) Insourced / contracted jobs: This includes all workers performing duties associated with the core business processes of the business (core business processes constitute those production and/or service processes essential for a specific business activity without which the business activity could not continue) on or off site, paid via a third party. It includes, for example, security guards employed by a contractor and workers employed via agencies or labor brokers, etc. \nIf the number of workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done at the end of the reporting period. If there is significant variation, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period using guidance above on calculating FTE for temporary workers. \nEXCLUSIONS. \nPlatform Jobs: If a company facilitates the trading of goods or services between two parties, but does not itself purchase those goods or services, the jobs created or sustained by that facilitation should not be included in Direct Jobs. For example, a platform company that facilitates customers accessing services from individuals, where the customer pays the individual providing the service, even where payment is done via the platform. The jobs within the company that facilitates the exchange (e.g., software programmers), or contractors paid by the company, should be counted under direct or contracted jobs, respectively. Construction Jobs: Only include construction jobs if the company is itself a construction or real estate company, and the jobs are therefore not expected to cease at the end of the construction phase of any individual asset. Construction jobs supported during the construction of a company’s assets are not included in this metric. All jobs associated with timebound construction projects should be captured under the metric: Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction). \n\nJII Guidance for Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction): \n\nAlignment comments: Alignment to the JII indicator requires using IRIS metrics Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) and Jobs Type (OD0660). Refer to each metric's usage guidance for details.\n\nJII definition: Number of temporary full-time equivalent workers hired for the construction of the investment project’s hard assets during the reporting period.\n\nJII guidance: \nFTE Calculation for Direct Jobs: Temporary workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on the average number of months worked over the total months in the reporting period (e.g., if worker worked for three months, this would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). \nSeasonal or short-term jobs are prorated on the basis of the portion of the reporting period that was worked (e.g., a full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). If the information is not available, the rule-of-thumb is two part-time jobs equal a full-time job.\nWhere companies employ piece-rate workers, consider headcount of number of workers paid piece-rate and an estimate of what proportion of FTE that category of workers are used for (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). \nSimilarly, where there are a large number of workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, please include average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), and the proportion of the year those workers are working for (e.g., 3 shifts of 100 people each day for the whole year: FTE = 3 x 100 x 12/12 = 300). If a temporary worker is part time, the calculation should be number of workers times proportion of a full working week times proportion of a year worked (e.g., FTE = 100 x 3/5 x 6/12 = 30)\nFull time Equivalent (FTE): Part-time jobs for construction workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). Full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year. \nConstruction Jobs (Temporary Construction): This indicator includes all workers involved in the construction of the company’s assets, including those employed by third parties if they are working on-site.\nTemporary means the jobs will cease when construction of the asset is completed and may include multi-year contracts for large assets.\nConstruction Companies: This metric does not include workers of construction companies where the client itself is a construction or real estate company. These workers are counted under the Direct Jobs Supported (operations and maintenance) metric.",

  'Calculation': '= Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) – Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687)',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs maintained during the reporting period at directly supported or financed enterprises. Organizations should measure the number of maintained full-time equivalent positions at the organization, regardless of the number of unique individuals employed or the positions they held. For example, if a full-time equivalent employee resigns and the position is filled, this position should count as just one full-time equivalent job maintained, and none created. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \n\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). \n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.  \n\nThis metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the number of unique rural households that received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. Examples of organizations that might report against this metric include those that provide products such as clean cookstoves or water purification systems and those that provide services such as home weatherization. Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.\n\nMany organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture whether (other) private sector firms entered the organization’s market during the reporting period. In some contexts, this metric measures increased competition that may be related to the organization’s success. However, the entry of new firms should not be attributed directly to the organization’s activities, nor can it be fully attributed to a specific intervention.\n\nIncreased competition in a relevant market is often accompanied by an increase in product or service quality or a decrease in product or service price, though these trends alone do not always indicate an entry of new firms; in particular, these trends may also result from the reaction of existing players in relevant markets to new entrants or potential new entrants. However, the entry of new firms into a market is easier to measure than changes in the strategy or positioning of existing firms in that market.\n\nThis metric applies only if the organization is expected to attract other firms to the same market and may be used alongside New Market Entry (OI3441) or Market Share Increased (OI4211). Data for this metric may be tracked annually (throughout a project cycle) or through an evaluation or survey. \n\nInternational Finance Institutions (IFIs) often use this metric as part of their analysis of private sector development.',

For example, if a calculation as above yields 25 hours for this metric, but within the reporting period school was cancelled for four hours in total because of snow or other bad weather, in that case would Learning Hours (PI1836) = (25 hours × number of weeks in the reporting period) - 4 hours.',

For example, a financial institution that provides a loan to a school may seek to gauge the income level of the targeted stakeholders of its loan by requiring the school receiving the loan to report this metric. Organizations are also encouraged to report metrics such as School Enrollment: Poor (PI7254), School Enrollment: Very Poor (PI5583), or School Enrollment: Low Income (PI2173) if they have additional demographic details available.\n\nOrganizations operating in the United States can refer to the following sources for additional information on free and reduced-price meal programs and eligibility:\n- New America: School Funding and Resources/Nutrition and Schools (http://atlas.newamerica.org/federal-school-nutrition-programs#toc-eligibility-and-enrollment)\n- USDA Food and Nutrition Service: Income Eligibility Guidelines (http://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines)\n\nOrganizations that wish to report on the number of subsidized or free school meals provided (both directly and indirectly by other organizations) can use the metric School Meals (PI6971).',

  'Definition': 'Average test score (as a percentage of a perfect score) earned by students served by the organization during the reporting period.',
  'Footnote': 'Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including which tests form the basis of this calculation.',
  'Calculation': '= Sum of student test scores as a percentage of a perfect score / School Enrollment (PI2389), disaggregated by Schooling Status (PI2250), option “Enrolled,” and by taking the standardized test × 100',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the average percent of total possible points students earned on tests during the reporting period. For example, if Student A earned 75/100 points and Student B earned 30/100 points, the Average Student Test Score for these two students would be 52.5/100 points, or 52.5%. Students who were not tested should not be included in this calculation.\n\nIn many cases, test-score data are collected by schools (public or private) or another third party. \n\nIn educational contexts, Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) can refer to students and may be used in this calculation in place of School Enrollment (PI2389). Organizations may also disaggregate data by grade level as needed to identify underlying patterns.\n\nIn all contexts, tests should reflect learners\' social, environmental, and learning norms and needs. Organizations are encouraged to footnote details on how and by whom tests have been developed, as well as how they are fit to context.\n\nAverage Student Test Score (PI9024), combined with factors included under "HOW is change happening?," gives a directional indicator of student learning outcomes. In some contexts, however, Student Promotion Rate (PI4924)—which measures the number of students proceeding to the next grade—may be a more appropriate outcome metric. In these cases, Student Promotion Rate (PI4924) should be substituted for Average Student Test Score (PI9024) under WHAT and HOW MUCH. For more details on calculation, see usage guidance for each specific metric in the catalog.\n\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the number of clients of the organization who were placed in jobs of any type during the reporting period. This metric, which is used to calculate Job Placement Rate (PI3527), may be particularly relevant to organizations that provide clients (for example, students) with vocational/technical training or employment services.\n\nOrganizations should include only those clients who were placed in and began jobs during the reporting period and exclude clients who were placed in jobs but did not begin work.\n\nFor work integrating social enterprises (WISE), a high job placement rate is an indicator of success. High rates of voluntary turnover can also be an indicator of success along these lines, which organizations can capture using Employee Voluntary Turnover Rate (OI1638).\n\nOrganizations are also encouraged to provide details on the types of activities they conducted to increase job placement rates, such as (but not limited to): monitoring workforce trends to ensure alignment between program offerings and workforce needs, surveying employers (to capture position offerings, skills needed, and likely wages), strengthening relationships with potential employers, providing resources (such as interview tips, career fairs, and job leads) to assist job searches and career development, and creating program alumni networks.\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact.

Some non-revenue water can be saved through appropriate technical and managerial actions. Water saved can then be used to meet currently unsatisfied demand (and hence to increase revenues to the utility) or to defer future capital expenditures in additional supply (and hence to reduce costs to the utility). For further detail, see IBNET (https://www.ib-net.org/toolkit/ibnet-indicators/non-revenue-water/).\n\nThis metric also aligns with HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicators for water and energy.

  'Footnote': 'Organizations selecting ‘Other’ should footnote the type of delivery methodology they use.',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture how organizations operating in microfinance (and primarily those providing lending services) deliver financial services.\n\nWith an individual lending methodology, a loan is made to an individual borrower who is solely responsible for its repayment.\n\nWith a solidarity group lending methodology, funds are disbursed to groups, with collection of repayment either from the group as a whole or from the individual members of that group. Borrowers in such groups often bear joint and several liability for the repayment of all loans to the group and its members. See the glossary term for additional information.\n\nWith a village/self-help group lending methodology, the organization provides access to credit and savings services through group- or community-managed associations. The organization may lend to the group, which in turn uses the provided funds to lend to its members. See the glossary term for additional information.\n\nWith agency banking, the organization extends their branch network to more distributed populations (e.g., rural populations) via authorized agents (branchless banking). Benefits of this methodology include cost-effectiveness, risk management, product availability, improved financial inclusion, and a wider customer base.\n\nWith licensed agents, individuals or businesses are empowered to act on behalf of a financial service provider (FSP) to perform certain financial or administrative transactions. They may have a direct contractual relationship with the FSP or may be contracted by a third party (a super-agent or aggregator) that maintains a service agreement with the FSP.\n\nRoving staff/mobile branches serve customers outside of branches in their places of residence or business. They may or may not be associated with a particular branch. This methodology includes only staff or mobile units that manage deposits or handle opening customer accounts (other than loan origination).\n\nWith ATMs (automated teller machines), customers access services via machines at fixed locations through different means of identification (card, PIN, biometrics). ATMs offer different kinds of cash- or non-cash-based operations (such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account balance consultation). ATMs may be proprietary or managed by third parties.\n\nWith mobile banking, clients access services through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) or Short Message Service (SMS) communications via their mobile devices.\n\nWith Internet-based banking services, clients access services through a personal device (smartphone app or website) using standard Internet protocols.\n\nWith merchant POS (point-of-sale) or network, a merchant uses a physical payment processing device, located at the merchant’s place of business and connected to a network, to accept payment for the sale of goods or services from customers of the financial service provider using their means of identification from the FSP (card or other). The merchant could be owned directly by the FSP or simply have access to a network enabling the merchant to process payments.\n\nOrganizations using an ‘other’ approach to delivering microfinance should describe the method or approach used.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the following resources for additional guidance:\n\n-Microfinance Information Exchange: Measuring the Performance of Alternative Delivery Channels (https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/about/what-we-do/mix)\n\n-International Finance Corporation: Digital Finance (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Industry_EXT_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Financial+Institutions/Priorities/Digital+Finance)',

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the value of voluntary savings accounts the organization manages as of the end of the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to footnote information on the average and median balances of the voluntary savings accounts managed, additional data points that can help estimate the typical savings level among the accounts’ owners. The average account balance can be calculated by dividing this metric by the Number of Voluntary Savings Accounts (PI6439).\n\nOrganizations reporting this metric may include savings programs with incentives or obligatory savings that clients can opt into (not including guarantees).\n\nWhile this metric measures the value of formal savings (voluntary savings accounts), those interested in measuring financial health may also wish to measure or estimate informal and non-cash savings.\n\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',

  'Usage Guidance': "This metric is intended to capture whether the organization analyzes clients’ repayment capacity. Lenders conduct repayment capacity analyses to compare a borrower's cash or income sources to a borrower's uses of credit, thereby ensuring that the borrower has sufficient sources to repay their debt. Repayment capacity analyses should be systematic and complete to ensure that lending decisions are based on an appropriate debt-to-income ratio.\n\nOrganizations should disclose the financial costs to borrowers for the most representative loan product, which closely tracks the cost clients carry. They should compare these costs with those of similar products offered to similar populations by other organizations in the same country or region.\n\nExamples of practices for repayment capacity analyses, to footnote, include, among others, relying on more information than just guarantees (whether peer guarantees, co-signature, or collateral), such as household surplus; taking into consideration the possibility of additional, undisclosed debt; disseminating the organization's repayment capacity policy among employees; uniformly applying the repayment capacity policy in practice; performing analyses at each loan cycle; and visiting clients to verify information. Organizations should also note whether they restructure products/services in cases where repayment is an issue.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the Smart Campaign (http://www.smartcampaign.org/storage/documents/avoidance.pdf) for further guidance on conducting repayment capacity analyses.",

Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. For further details on these measures and practical application in the investment context, see IADB’s "The Use of Effective Coverage in the Evaluation of Maternal and Child Health Programs: A Technical Note for the IDB’s Social Protection and Health” (https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Use-of-Effective-Coverage-in-the-Evaluation-of-Maternal-and-Child-Health-Programs-A-Technical-Note-for-the-IDB-Social-Protection-and-Health-Division.pdf) and “Effective coverage as a new approach to health system performance assessment: a scoping review” (https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3692-7). For background on the measure itself, see “Access, utilization, quality, and effective coverage: an integrated conceptual framework and measurement strategy” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953604006070?via%3Dihub).\n\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact).

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the ecosystem services provided by land or marine area the organization directly or indirectly controls. Note that what is most critical for organizations to capture is not necessarily the long list of ecosystem services provided, but rather the key ecosystem services and their quality. Organizations may choose to identify the top 3-5 ecosystem services provided from this list, then track their changes in quality over time.\n\nThe number, variety, and balance of ecosystem services is a good indicator of ecosystem health. A disproportionate share of human-induced provisioning services like crops and timber generally indicates poor ecosystem health (e.g., intensive agriculture, intensive forestry). The value of  ecosystem services can be expressed in physical (e.g., amount of groundwater supplied in m³) or monetary terms. Monetary valuation of ecosystem services is complex and requires expert support but enables comparison and aggregation. Assessing ecosystem services at the site or project level uses specific tools such as InVEST or Aries and generally requires expert advice. \n\nThe societal value of ecosystems is deeply related to the benefits they provide people, specifically ecosystem services, making this metric a proxy for the social value of biodiversity. Organizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.\n\nExamples of details to footnote include how the ecosystem provides the selected ecosystem services, the methodology used to measure and value the ecosystem services, information on which services were covered, and any external validation or verification conducted to evaluate the provision of the selected ecosystem services. For external validation or verification, organizations should footnote which services were covered, the date of evaluation, and the entity conducting verification/validation (e.g., university researcher, consultant, ecosystem services bank).\n\nOrganizations can apply this metric in risk screening (‘which ecosystem services are at risk due to the investment?’), identifying restoration opportunities (‘which ecosystem services can benefit from an investment in restoration?’), and comparison (‘which product innovations or locations for restoration are most promising in terms of generating ecosystem services?’).\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Protected Land Area: Total (PI4716), Protected Land Area: Permanent (PI3924), Land Directly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (OI6912), Land Indirectly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (PI6796), Land Directly Controlled: Total (OI5408), and Land Indirectly Controlled: Total (PI3789).\n\nThe detailed options for this metric were sourced from the World Resources Institute (WRI).',

This metric helps capture holistically how a specific project complements previous conservation work. Adjacent land that is also subject to conservation measures maximizes the impact of conservation measures in newly protected areas. Potential adverse effects of adjacent land use, which organizations can footnote, may extend into the protected area. On the other hand, the transition area (ecotone) between the protected area and adjacent land can provide edge habitats that support rich biodiversity.\n\nRemote sensing data or field visits can capture the area and land use of adjacent parcels, including details on their extent, vegetation, species, and relief, which can help optimize management in controlled area.

  'Usage Guidance': "This metric is intended to capture how much wastewater derived from an organization's productive or operational processes is treated.\n\nWastewater, or water that carries wastes, is usually a mixture of water and dissolved or suspended solids. Treatment aims to improve the quality of the wastewater before the remaining water is discharged back to the environment by reducing suspended solids, biodegradable organics, pathogenic bacteria, and nutrients. Wastewater treatment typically takes place over three levels: primary (mechanical), secondary (biological), and tertiary.

Biodiversity and much of the global population face water shortages due to drying out of habitats, leading to drinking water shortages, salinization, and failed harvests. Knowledge of water stress levels can guide organizations’ design and focus of sustainable water management plans, including irrigation methods, urban planning, and wastewater reuse.\n\nOrganizations may use tools such as the Water Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) or WWF–DEG's Water Risk Filter (http://waterriskfilter.panda.org/) to find data on and describe water stress on directly or indirectly managed land. Remote sensing data are also a valuable source of information on water stress and its impact on ecosystems anywhere in the world; such data are often available at small spatial scale, if needed.\n\nThis metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome.

Put inversely, this metric is intended to capture the degree to which rivers and streams are fragmented, which can negatively impact stream health, land health, and biodiversity within ecosystems.\n\nIn addition to remote sensing data, organizations may use tools such as WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) or WWF-DEG's Water Risk Filter (http://waterriskfilter.panda.org/) to find data on and describe stream connectivity on directly or indirectly managed land.\n\nAssessing stream connectivity helps to understand a project’s contribution to preserving biodiversity, as fragmentation of natural habitat is a primary driver of biodiversity loss. This indicator corresponds to the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, which aims to improve biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity.\n\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the level of water treatment enacted by the organization during the reporting period. Organizations may report the level of treatment for any water or effluents at the point of discharge, whether treated themselves onsite or sent to a third party for treatment. Both lagoon and mechanical treatment can be included, where appropriate.\n\nThis metric applies to all elements of water discharge, including used water, unused water, and effluents. Organizations may use this metric to disaggregate Water Discharged (OD0386) by volume of water treated. For sanitation-related investments, organizations should disaggregate and apply this calculation specifically to wastewater. \n\nTreating water aims to improve water’s quality to make it more acceptable for an end-use, such as drinking, industry, or safe return to the environment, by removing or reducing existing water contaminants. Increasing population pressure is increasing the amount of wastewater. Untreated effluent is discharged to water bodies and terrestrial ecosystems, leading to nutrient surpluses (which can cause anoxic conditions and species loss) and the presence of toxic, often non-degradable compounds in ecosystems. Untreated wastewater contains pathogens that can contaminate drinking water. Treating and recycling polluted water can help tackle water shortages.\n\nMinimum requirements for treatment might be specified by national, sub-national, or local legislation; in setting treatment levels, however, organizations should consider the impacts of their overall water discharge and the needs of other water users. For further guidance on treatment requirements, see SDG 6: Progress on Wastewater Treatment (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275967/9789241514897-eng.pdf?ua=1).',

For example, disaggregating Number of Individual Connections (P3317) by Connection Type (PD1310), option "Phone: Mobile," would yield the number of mobile-phone connections provided by the organization to individuals during the reporting period. \n\nThis metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',

  'Footnote': 'Organizations should footnote details on their or their product’s biodiversity footprint and how it was assessed, including all assumptions used. See usage guidance for further information.',
  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the organization’s or product’s biodiversity footprint, a measure of impact on the intactness of an ecosystem usually expressed relative to an undisturbed state. Biodiversity footprint can be assessed at the level of a product, a project, a site, or the entire organization. While it does not require time- and cost-intensive field surveys, this metric is not intended to offer an extremely accurate or holistic picture of biodiversity performance. Organizations can apply this metric in benchmarking (‘which companies in my portfolio are scoring well in terms of biodiversity?’), tracking progress to target (‘are companies in my portfolio evolving towards improved biodiversity performance?’), and comparison (‘which investment options are most promising in terms of biodiversity performance?’). \n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to apply standard indicators for biodiversity footprint. Typically based on a combination of extent (surface), condition, and significance of the local ecosystem, commonly applied condition indicators include Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF), often combined with surface metrics (e.g., MSA.ha or MSA per hectare). PDF expresses the (potential) loss of species, while MSA expresses the abundance of species remaining (MSA, as a measure of current intactness, is preferred for this IRIS indicator). These indicators are often normalized to fall between 0 and 1; with MSA, for instance, no biodiversity is left when MSA = 0, while a very pristine area has MSA = 1. Both MSA\nand PDF can be used across all sectors and across all countries and (eco)regions. For more on these measures as well as an overall discussion of the biodiversity footprint and its application to different asset classes, see the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF)’s “Paving the way towards a harmonised biodiversity accounting approach for the financial sector” (https://www.pbafglobal.com/about-pbaf#first-version-of-the-pbaf-standard). \n\nAvailable biodiversity measurement tools use models that include drivers of biodiversity loss such as land use changes, GHG emissions, and pollution. Organizations are encouraged, albeit with caution, to embrace innovative measurement approaches to improve accuracy. Interesting work to standardize data and measurement approaches is available from:\n- European Business & Biodiversity Platform’s workstreams on methods (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/biodiversity/business/workstreams/methods/index_en.htm)\n- WWF (2021, https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_assessing_portfolio_impacts_final.pdf)\n- Pioneers (with an explicit focus on the financial sector).\n- Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF) (https://www.pbafglobal.com/about-pbaf#first-version-of-the-pbaf-standard).\n\nThe Guide on Biodiversity Measurement Approaches from the Finance for Biodiversity Community provides excellent biodiversity measurement approaches at the portfolio level that are highly relevant for financial institutions: \n- Biodiversity Footprint for Financial Institutions (BFFI)\n- Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) and the Biodiversity Impact Analysis (BIA)\n- Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF)\n- Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) indicator\n\nInvestors are strongly encouraged to contextualize their projects – and ideally select projects – based on broader, country- or region-level biodiversity and landscape assessments focused on site irreplaceability. Viewing biodiversity through the lens of a systematic conservation plan enables more efficient, impact goal-oriented management decisions.  \n\nFor an example of one financial institution’s process and approach, see BNP Paribas’s “Our roadmap for addressing biodiversity loss” (https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/investing/our-roadmap-to-addressing-biodiversity-loss/). \n ',

Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. However, there are not, as of yet, broadly standardized ratios for the “quality of the intervention” element of the calculation. IRIS users are encouraged to document all assumptions used in calculating this measure as well as to use existing publications such as the following to inform their approaches: \n-\tIADB’s "The Use of Effective Coverage in the Evaluation of Maternal and Child Health Programs: A Technical Note for the IDB’s Social Protection and Health” (https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Use-of-Effective-Coverage-in-the-Evaluation-of-Maternal-and-Child-Health-Programs-A-Technical-Note-for-the-IDB-Social-Protection-and-Health-Division.pdf)\n-\t“Effective coverage as a new approach to health system performance assessment: a scoping review” (https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3692-7#:~:text=In%20their%20work%2C%20effective%20coverage%20combines%20three%20widely,which%20is%20actually%20delivered%20%5B%201%2C%2010%20%5D). \n-\t“Access, utilization, quality, and effective coverage: an integrated conceptual framework and measurement strategy” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953604006070?via%3Dihub).\n\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',

  'Usage Guidance': "This metric is intended to capture the adequacy of target stakeholders’ access to food by asking them directly about their experiences. Organizations should apply this metric to a metric or set of metrics that defines the relevant set of target stakeholders. For example, some organizations might report Client Households: Total (PI7954), disaggregated by relevant options from Target Stakeholder Demographics (PD5752). Other organizations with a different target stakeholder might instead apply this metric to Supplier Individuals: Total (PI5350).\n\nThis indicator is based on and refers to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) developed by FAO’s Voices of the Hungry Project. The FIES is an experience-based measure of food insecurity severity that relies on people’s direct responses to questions about their experiences facing constrained access to food. The FIES can be used to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity at different levels of severity, which is key information for implementing policies that aim to realize the human right to food. The FIES Survey Module (FIES-SM) comprises eight questions regarding people's access to adequate food and can be easily integrated into various types of surveys. For more on FIES, including the questions translated into over 170 languages, link to SDG 2.1.2, and free data analysis tools, see FAO’s FIES website (https://www.fao.org/in-action/voices-of-the-hungry/background/en/).
