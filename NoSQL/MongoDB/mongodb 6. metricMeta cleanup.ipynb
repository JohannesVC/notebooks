Note that land ownership is not always equivalent to control. For example, where land is leased to another entity or individual to cultivate (e.g., a third-party manager), land is only directly controlled if the lease is accompanied by exhaustive criteria for land use.\\n\\nSuch land-use criteria are often included in management plans and legal agreements that also incorporate sustainability principles and typically include termination provisions in the event of poor performance. To the extent that the third-party manager must make minimal, ad-hoc, and discretionary land-use decisions that fall outside the scope of the land-use criteria, the land may still be considered directly controlled by the organization.\",\n",

Organizations should report yield from the most recent harvest and footnote details on the unit of measure.\\n\\nThis metric could be valuable for organizations that sell inputs (such as fertilizer or irrigation equipment) to farmers that help improve yields.\\n\\nOrganizations interested in reporting the yields of supplier farmers should report Average Supplier Agriculture Yield: Total (PI2046).\\n\\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.\",\n",

CITES provides information on species threatened by international trade. Local endangered species platforms, such as those provided by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, are also available. Species are categorized in these databases according to their degree of extinction, which suggests a corresponding prioritization of conservation measures for species and their habitats.

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'NOTE: This metric will be deprecated in a forthcoming update to the IRIS Catalog of Metrics. Users are advised to instead report Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) disaggregated by Active Use (PI7985).\\n\\nThis metric is intended to capture the number of unique clients who were active users of the organization’s services as of the end of the reporting period; this metric is more relevant to organizations providing services than to those providing products. Organizations wishing to report total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184) and related submetrics. Organizations wishing to report the number of unique clients during the course of the reporting period can report on Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.\\n\\nFor financial institutions (including microfinance institutions), this metric would include the number of individuals who currently have outstanding loan balances with the organization. For those financial institutions offering deposit products, this metric would include the number of individuals who have active deposit accounts with the organization. For those financial institutions offering insurance products, this metric would include those with active insurance policies. In all cases, the reported number should be based on the number of individuals, rather than the number of groups or number of active policies/accounts.\\n\\nThe definition of active may vary by offering. For example, for traditional financial services, “active” may include all individuals who have accounts registered in their names for at least six months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior six months. For digital financial services, “active” may include individuals who have had accounts registered in their names for at least three months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior three months.\\n\\nThis metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.\\n\\nMany organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.\\n\\nFor healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.\\n\\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture all unique clients who received products or services provided by the organization for which it did not request payment and for which it does not expect reimbursement. If the organization expects or receives payment from someone other than the client, these client individuals should be reported against Client Individuals: No Direct Payment (PI1807). This metric is intended to measure clients receiving free products/services that are core to the operations of the organization providing them; for example, some healthcare clinics provide free health check-ups.\\n\\nOrganizations should include the number of unique client individuals who received free products or services, regardless of whether or not these same individuals also paid the organization for certain products or services during the reporting period.\\n\\nThis metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.\\n\\nMany organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.\\n\\nFor healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.\\n\\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

Senior management is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management (usually executive level positions) who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They are often referred to as the “C-suite” and include positions such as Chief Executive Officer – CEO; Chief Financial Officer – CFO; Chief Marketing Officer – CMO; Chief Operations Officer – COO; Chief Information Officer – CIO; Chief Legal Counsel – CLC, etc. Within different corporations, they can also sometimes be referred to as executive management, top management, or upper management. \\n\\nJII guidance: This metric is intended to capture female representation in Senior Management. Practitioners will need to collect \"Total Number of Senior Managers\" to get a percentage. Female Senior Managers may also hold ownership stakes or Board or Investment Committee positions in the organization. As such, Practitioners should avoid double-counting women who fill multiple roles within an organization by not aggregating HIPSO\\'s \"Number of Women in Senior Management\" with \"Number of Women on the Board\", \"Number of Investment Committee members who are female\", or \"Female Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance)\". Practitioners may also refer to sector-specific gender leadership benchmarks and application guidance as needed, such as those specified by the 2X Challenge (www.2xchallenge.org). \\n\\nJII applicability: All client companies, where relevant. Practitioners may use the metric for investment fund investees, where relevant, but typically not used for clients of other intermediated finance (e.g. commercial banks).',\n",

A living wage is sufficient to cover food, water, clothing, transport, education, health care, and other essential needs for workers and their officially entitled dependents, along with some discretionary income. Workers should also receive equal pay for equal work. For more on this definition, see CHRB (https://www.corporatebenchmark.org/).\\n\\nSince the living wage varies with geography, IRIS+ does not define a living wage. However, the following resources are recommended for companies with workers located in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or the United States. Organizations with workers in other geographies may reference the Global Living Wage Coalition (https://www.globallivingwage.org) to find out if a living wage benchmark is available in that geography. \\n\\n- Living Wage Canada (http://livingwagecanada.ca)\\n- Living Wage for Ireland (https://www.livingwage.ie)\\n- Living Wage New Zealand (https://www.livingwage.org.nz/) \\n- UK: Living Wage Foundation (http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation)\\n- United States: MIT Living Wage Calculator (http://livingwage.mit.edu)\\n\\nAll organizations should footnote the living wage levels they have used for this metric.\\n\\nThis metric is multidimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Mission statements establish the long-term direction and goals that guide an organization's daily operations, providing a foundation for an organization's activities, communications, organizational structure, and culture.\\n\\nInternally, mission statements are often used to inspire employees, board members, and volunteers; guide leaders' decision-making; support the organization's theory of change (see Theory of Change [OD6350]); and help set goals (see Social and Environmental Targets [OD4091]). Externally, mission statements are often used to generate external support and communicate goals and aspirations to stakeholders.\\n\\nOrganizations can refer to the SPI4 (http://cerise-spi4.squarespace.com/), specifically Essential Practice 1a1, for additional indicators related to well-crafted mission statements. SPI4 is a social audit tool, developed for financial service providers, which can apply to any organization with both social and financial objectives.\",\n",

       "  'Usage Guidance': \"This metric is intended to capture the number of employees who received a regular, routine performance and career development review during the reporting period. To qualify under this metric, reviews must be based on clear criteria understood by both the manager and employee, must occur with adequate notice to the employee, and must occur at least once per year. A review may—but is not required to—include an evaluation by the employee’s direct superior, their peers, a wider range of employees, or the human resources department, as well as the employee's own reflections on their quality of work. \\n\\nThis metric is sourced from Disclosure 404-3 in GRI 404: Training and Education 2016: Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews. \\n\\nRegular performance reviews support the professional development of employees, contribute to skills management, and build human capital within the organization. Such reviews can also increase employee satisfaction, which can improve organizational performance. \\n\\nThis metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. The selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.\",\n",

Strikes and lockouts sometimes represent a breakdown in labor–management relations and a suspension of consultative processes. Data regarding the occurrence of such industrial incidents can usefully convey the state of labor–management relations and the direction of its progression over time. Strikes and lockouts must be set in the context of any limitations of local legislation and benchmarked against norms for inter-country, inter-industry, and inter-category comparisons. As employees take greater freedom in questioning their rights and respect in the workplace, organizations may observe strikes and lockouts increasing. As policies begin to take hold and change is effected, strikes and lockouts may then decrease.\\n\\nAn employee strike is a work stoppage caused by one or several of the following voluntary actions by a number of employees: reducing the normal performance of their employment, breaking their employment agreements, refusing or failing to accept engagement for work in which they are usually employed, reducing their normal output, or reducing their normal rate of work. A strike usually happens in response to employee grievances.\\n\\nA lockout, also a work stoppage, is a temporary denial of employment initiated by the employer. Lockouts sometimes occur as a bargaining tactic by the employer in response to an employee strike.\",\n",

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations and in low-income areas during the reporting period.\\n\\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.”\\n\\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\\n\\nOrganizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on defining low-income areas. \\n\\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\\n\\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.\\n\\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.\\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\\n\\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations during the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \\n\\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.” \\n\\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\\n\\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\\n\\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \\n\\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\\n\\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs at all financed or directly supported enterprises as of the end of the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \\n\\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party and directly related to operations and maintenance of company.” To align to the HIPSO indicator Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction), organizations should include only the data for Jobs Type (OD0660) options “Permanence: Temporary (One-Time)” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party, but not directly related to operations and maintenance of company.”\\n\\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\\n\\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\\n\\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \\n\\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \\n\\nThis metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',\n",

If a temporary worker is part time, the calculation should be number of workers times proportion of a full working week times proportion of a year worked (e.g., FTE = 100 x 3/5 x 6/12 = 30)\\nFull time Equivalent (FTE): Part-time jobs for construction workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). Full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year. \\nDirect Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance): In order to fully capture all direct jobs, consider these: \\n(a) Senior Management: Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in senior management roles working for the client company or project at the end of the reporting period. Senior management is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management (usually executive level positions) who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They are often referred to as the “C-suite” and include positions such as Chief Executive Officer – CEO; Chief Financial Officer – CFO; Chief Marketing Officer – CMO; Chief Operations Officer – COO; Chief Information Officer – CIO; Chief Legal Counsel – CLC, etc. Within different corporations, they can also sometimes be referred to as executive management, top management, or upper management. \\n(b) Permanent full time direct jobs (not including management): Please report number of workers at the end of the reporting period. FTE = headcount for this category of workers. These are generally workers on the payroll. \\n(c) Permanent part time direct jobs (not including management): This includes workers converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). These are part time workers on the payroll, including those working variable hours. If the average proportion of full-time figure is not known, 0.5 can be used as an estimate. \\n(d)Temporary direct jobs: All workers paid directly by the company, but engaged only for a specific period of time, including fixed-term, project- or task-based contracts, as well as seasonal or casual work, including day labor. It includes those on written and verbal contracts, performing work on or off-site, associated with the operations and maintenance of the business. If the number of temporary workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done based on the number of workers at the end of the reporting period (converting headcount to FTE for any workers who are part time, see below). If there is significant variation during the year, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period as follows. \\n(e) Insourced / contracted jobs: This includes all workers performing duties associated with the core business processes of the business (core business processes constitute those production and/or service processes essential for a specific business activity without which the business activity could not continue) on or off site, paid via a third party. It includes, for example, security guards employed by a contractor and workers employed via agencies or labor brokers, etc. \\nIf the number of workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done at the end of the reporting period. If there is significant variation, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period using guidance above on calculating FTE for temporary workers. \\nEXCLUSIONS. \\nPlatform Jobs: If a company facilitates the trading of goods or services between two parties, but does not itself purchase those goods or services, the jobs created or sustained by that facilitation should not be included in Direct Jobs. For example, a platform company that facilitates customers accessing services from individuals, where the customer pays the individual providing the service, even where payment is done via the platform. The jobs within the company that facilitates the exchange (e.g., software programmers), or contractors paid by the company, should be counted under direct or contracted jobs, respectively. Construction Jobs: Only include construction jobs if the company is itself a construction or real estate company, and the jobs are therefore not expected to cease at the end of the construction phase of any individual asset. Construction jobs supported during the construction of a company’s assets are not included in this metric. All jobs associated with timebound construction projects should be captured under the metric: Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction). \\n\\nJII Guidance for Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction): \\n\\nAlignment comments: Alignment to the JII indicator requires using IRIS metrics Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) and Jobs Type (OD0660).

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs maintained during the reporting period at directly supported or financed enterprises. Organizations should measure the number of maintained full-time equivalent positions at the organization, regardless of the number of unique individuals employed or the positions they held. For example, if a full-time equivalent employee resigns and the position is filled, this position should count as just one full-time equivalent job maintained, and none created. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \\n\\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). \\n\\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\\n\\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\\n\\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \\n\\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.  \\n\\nThis metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.\\n\\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.\",\n",

High rates of voluntary turnover can also be an indicator of success along these lines, which organizations can capture using Employee Voluntary Turnover Rate (OI1638).\\n\\nOrganizations are also encouraged to provide details on the types of activities they conducted to increase job placement rates, such as (but not limited to): monitoring workforce trends to ensure alignment between program offerings and workforce needs, surveying employers (to capture position offerings, skills needed, and likely wages), strengthening relationships with potential employers, providing resources (such as interview tips, career fairs, and job leads) to assist job searches and career development, and creating program alumni networks.\\n\\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture the organization’s theory of change. A theory of change (also referred to as a Theory of Value Creation or Logic Model) expresses the sequence of cause-and-effect actions or occurrences by which organizational and financial resources are hypothesized to convert into the desired social and environmental results. It provides a conceptual roadmap for how an organization expects to achieve its intended impact. Often displayed in a diagram, many theories of change can be expressed as a series of if–then statements, specifying what the organization does and the expected results of each activity. A framework built around the concepts of activities, inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts is called a Logic Model or Impact Value Chain. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information and resources.\\n\\nWherever possible, organizations’ theories of change should refer to relevant IRIS metrics.\\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to footnote information on the defined outcomes they seek to achieve for their targeted stakeholders (e.g., clients, employees, distributors, suppliers, and/or the environment). Defined outcomes include specific targets that can be measured. Many are based on existing literature. Organizations are encouraged to footnote information on the evidence base that substantiates the logic chain linking outputs to defined outcomes. This evidence base might include credible secondary research, randomized control trials (RCT), longitudinal studies, primary research (such as customer surveys or stakeholder feedback forums), and qualitative interviews or case studies.\\n\\nFor example, an organization that provides training to and sources from smallholder farmers might only report on the number of farmers trained (Individuals Trained: Total [PI2998]), the number of smallholder farmers sourced from (Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI9991]), and the total payments made to those farmers (Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI7852]). However, its theory of change might describe how these outputs lead to outcomes, such as helping farmers build larger and more productive farms, and impacts, such as improved livelihoods, pointing to external research that supports this connection.',\n",

Community engagement strategies involve intentional approaches to align the development priorities of local communities with the goals of the organization.\\n\\nExamples of strategy elements, to footnote, may include: providing deliberate resources (e.g., employee time and skills, in-kind giving, leadership) to community organizations or individuals, providing education and skills training, creating opportunities for employee volunteering and fundraising, contracting to local suppliers, lobbying to strengthen local issues, facilitating discussions with local leaders, integrating the company's community engagement activities into organizational functions, creating institutional policies and incentives for community engagement, and measuring the social impact of the organization's community engagement activities.\\n\\nThe strategy may also dictate methods (e.g., memoranda of understanding) for considering, informing, and consulting with existing community groups before implementing organizational activities that affect the community. For example, organizations may assess and take into account existing formal, informal, and historic land-use rights of local communities or Indigenous peoples prior to operations that affect the land.\\n\\nHistorical land titles offer one way to evaluate which communities to engage. LandMark (http://www.landmarkmap.org/) provides data on Indigenous and community land rights. In engaging the community, organizations should use a consent process to ensure that the entire community endorses the project and not just a few elite members.\\n\\nBiodiversity conservation projects will often require involving traditional landowners or others from the community who rely on the land.\\n\\nOrganizations can refer to the following sources for further guidance on community engagement strategies:\\n\\n- Community Planning Toolkit (http://www.communityplanningtoolkit.org/sites/default/files/Engagement0815.pdf)\\n- International Finance Corporation's Strategic Community Investment: A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-ifc/publications/publications_handbook_communityinvestment__wci__1319576907570)\\n- The Conference Board's The Civic 50: Best Practices in Corporate Community Engagement (https://conference-board.org/publications/Civic-50-Corporate-Communication-Practices)\\n- World Bank's Community Engagement Planning Tool (http://wbi.worldbank.org/sske/resource-library/community-engagement-planning-tool)\\n- World Bank's Participation Sourcebook (http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1996/02/696745/world-bank-participation-sourcebook)\",\n",

A target stakeholder can be a client, employee, or anyone the organization is aiming to positively impact. Some organizations call a target stakeholder a ‘beneficiary.’\\n\\nTarget stakeholders—whether clients, employees, or others—should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.  \\n\\n\\nThe categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.\\n\\nThis metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

This includes individuals hired directly and individuals hired through third party agencies, as long as those individuals provide services related to the operations and maintenance of the client company or investment project. This also includes full-time equivalent worked by seasonal, contractual and part-time workers.\\n\\nJII guidance: \\nFTE Calculation for Direct Jobs: Temporary workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on the average number of months worked over the total months in the reporting period (e.g., if worker worked for three months, this would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). Seasonal or short-term jobs are prorated on the basis of the portion of the reporting period that was worked (e.g., a full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year). If the information is not available, the rule-of-thumb is two part-time jobs equal a full-time job. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider headcount of number of workers paid piece-rate and an estimate of what proportion of FTE that category of workers are used for (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). \\nSimilarly, where there are a large number of workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, please include average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), and the proportion of the year those workers are working for (e.g., 3 shifts of 100 people each day for the whole year: FTE = 3 x 100 x 12/12 = 300). If a temporary worker is part time, the calculation should be number of workers times proportion of a full working week times proportion of a year worked (e.g., FTE = 100 x 3/5 x 6/12 = 30)\\nFull time Equivalent (FTE): Part-time jobs for construction workers are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). Full-time position for three months would be equal to a 0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year. \\nDirect Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance): In order to fully capture all direct jobs, consider these: \\n(a) Senior Management: Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in senior management roles working for the client company or project at the end of the reporting period. Senior management is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management (usually executive level positions) who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They are often referred to as the “C-suite” and include positions such as Chief Executive Officer – CEO; Chief Financial Officer – CFO; Chief Marketing Officer – CMO; Chief Operations Officer – COO; Chief Information Officer – CIO; Chief Legal Counsel – CLC, etc. Within different corporations, they can also sometimes be referred to as executive management, top management, or upper management. \\n(b) Permanent full time direct jobs (not including management): Please report number of workers at the end of the reporting period. FTE = headcount for this category of workers. These are generally workers on the payroll. \\n(c) Permanent part time direct jobs (not including management): This includes workers converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definition (e.g., if working week equals 40 hours, a 24 hr./week job would be equal to 0.6 FTE job). These are part time workers on the payroll, including those working variable hours. If the average proportion of full-time figure is not known, 0.5 can be used as an estimate. \\n(d)Temporary direct jobs: All workers paid directly by the company, but engaged only for a specific period of time, including fixed-term, project- or task-based contracts, as well as seasonal or casual work, including day labor. It includes those on written and verbal contracts, performing work on or off-site, associated with the operations and maintenance of the business. If the number of temporary workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done based on the number of workers at the end of the reporting period (converting headcount to FTE for any workers who are part time, see below). If there is significant variation during the year, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period as follows. \\n(e) Insourced / contracted jobs: This includes all workers performing duties associated with the core business processes of the business (core business processes constitute those production and/or service processes essential for a specific business activity without which the business activity could not continue) on or off site, paid via a third party. It includes, for example, security guards employed by a contractor and workers employed via agencies or labor brokers, etc. \\nIf the number of workers does not vary significantly on a seasonal basis, the FTE calculation can be done at the end of the reporting period. If there is significant variation, please report an FTE figure over the reporting period using guidance above on calculating FTE for temporary workers. \\nEXCLUSIONS. \\nPlatform Jobs: If a company facilitates the trading of goods or services between two parties, but does not itself purchase those goods or services, the jobs created or sustained by that facilitation should not be included in Direct Jobs. For example, a platform company that facilitates customers accessing services from individuals, where the customer pays the individual providing the service, even where payment is done via the platform. The jobs within the company that facilitates the exchange (e.g., software programmers), or contractors paid by the company, should be counted under direct or contracted jobs, respectively. Construction Jobs: Only include construction jobs if the company is itself a construction or real estate company, and the jobs are therefore not expected to cease at the end of the construction phase of any individual asset. Construction jobs supported during the construction of a company’s assets are not included in this metric. All jobs associated with timebound construction projects should be captured under the metric: Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction). \\n\\nJII Guidance for Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction): \\n\\nAlignment comments: Alignment to the JII indicator requires using IRIS metrics Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) and Jobs Type (OD0660).

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture jobs in low-income areas maintained during the reporting period at directly supported or financed enterprises. \\n\\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation).\\n\\nOrganizations should measure the number of maintained full-time equivalent positions at the organization, regardless of the number of unique individuals employed or the positions they held. For example, if a full-time equivalent employee resigns and the position is filled, this position should count as just one full-time equivalent job maintained, and none created.\\n\\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\\n\\nOrganizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on defining low-income areas. \\n\\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \\n\\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.\\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\\n\\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Respondents should rank their likelihood to recommend on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing \"not at all likely to recommend,\" 10 representing \"extremely likely to recommend,\"and 5 representing \"neutral.\" Target stakeholders ranking themselves as a 9 or 10 are considered \"extremely likely\" or \"Promoters.\" Target stakeholders ranking themselves as a 7 or 8 are considered \"Passives.\" Target stakeholders ranking themselves as 0-6 are considered \"unlikely\" or \"Detractors.\"\\n\\nUsers may report this metric with Client Feedback System (OI5049) as the system by which this feedback is solicited.\\n\\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see specific guidance document. No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.',\n",

Biodiversity footprint can be assessed at the level of a product, a project, a site, or the entire organization. While it does not require time- and cost-intensive field surveys, this metric is not intended to offer an extremely accurate or holistic picture of biodiversity performance. Organizations can apply this metric in benchmarking (‘which companies in my portfolio are scoring well in terms of biodiversity?’), tracking progress to target (‘are companies in my portfolio evolving towards improved biodiversity performance?’), and comparison (‘which investment options are most promising in terms of biodiversity performance?’). \\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.\\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to apply standard indicators for biodiversity footprint. Typically based on a combination of extent (surface), condition, and significance of the local ecosystem, commonly applied condition indicators include Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF), often combined with surface metrics (e.g., MSA.ha or MSA per hectare). PDF expresses the (potential) loss of species, while MSA expresses the abundance of species remaining (MSA, as a measure of current intactness, is preferred for this IRIS indicator). These indicators are often normalized to fall between 0 and 1; with MSA, for instance, no biodiversity is left when MSA = 0, while a very pristine area has MSA = 1. Both MSA\\nand PDF can be used across all sectors and across all countries and (eco)regions. For more on these measures as well as an overall discussion of the biodiversity footprint and its application to different asset classes, see the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF)’s “Paving the way towards a harmonised biodiversity accounting approach for the financial sector” (https://www.pbafglobal.com/about-pbaf#first-version-of-the-pbaf-standard). \\n\\nAvailable biodiversity measurement tools use models that include drivers of biodiversity loss such as land use changes, GHG emissions, and pollution.

Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. However, there are not, as of yet, broadly standardized ratios for the “quality of the intervention” element of the calculation. IRIS users are encouraged to document all assumptions used in calculating this measure as well as to use existing publications such as the following to inform their approaches: \\n-\\tIADB’s \"The Use of Effective Coverage in the Evaluation of Maternal and Child Health Programs: A Technical Note for the IDB’s Social Protection and Health” (https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Use-of-Effective-Coverage-in-the-Evaluation-of-Maternal-and-Child-Health-Programs-A-Technical-Note-for-the-IDB-Social-Protection-and-Health-Division.pdf)\\n-\\t“Effective coverage as a new approach to health system performance assessment: a scoping review” (https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3692-7#:~:text=In%20their%20work%2C%20effective%20coverage%20combines%20three%20widely,which%20is%20actually%20delivered%20%5B%201%2C%2010%20%5D). \\n-\\t“Access, utilization, quality, and effective coverage: an integrated conceptual framework and measurement strategy” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953604006070?via%3Dihub).\\n\\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

       "  'Usage Guidance': 'This metric is intended to capture how organizations operating in microfinance (and primarily those providing lending services) deliver financial services.\\n\\nWith an individual lending methodology, a loan is made to an individual borrower who is solely responsible for its repayment.\\n\\nWith a solidarity group lending methodology, funds are disbursed to groups, with collection of repayment either from the group as a whole or from the individual members of that group. Borrowers in such groups often bear joint and several liability for the repayment of all loans to the group and its members. See the glossary term for additional information.\\n\\nWith a village/self-help group lending methodology, the organization provides access to credit and savings services through group- or community-managed associations. The organization may lend to the group, which in turn uses the provided funds to lend to its members. See the glossary term for additional information.\\n\\nWith agency banking, the organization extends their branch network to more distributed populations (e.g., rural populations) via authorized agents (branchless banking). Benefits of this methodology include cost-effectiveness, risk management, product availability, improved financial inclusion, and a wider customer base.\\n\\nWith licensed agents, individuals or businesses are empowered to act on behalf of a financial service provider (FSP) to perform certain financial or administrative transactions. They may have a direct contractual relationship with the FSP or may be contracted by a third party (a super-agent or aggregator) that maintains a service agreement with the FSP.\\n\\nRoving staff/mobile branches serve customers outside of branches in their places of residence or business. They may or may not be associated with a particular branch. This methodology includes only staff or mobile units that manage deposits or handle opening customer accounts (other than loan origination).\\n\\nWith ATMs (automated teller machines), customers access services via machines at fixed locations through different means of identification (card, PIN, biometrics). ATMs offer different kinds of cash- or non-cash-based operations (such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account balance consultation). ATMs may be proprietary or managed by third parties.\\n\\nWith mobile banking, clients access services through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) or Short Message Service (SMS) communications via their mobile devices.\\n\\nWith Internet-based banking services, clients access services through a personal device (smartphone app or website) using standard Internet protocols.\\n\\nWith merchant POS (point-of-sale) or network, a merchant uses a physical payment processing device, located at the merchant’s place of business and connected to a network, to accept payment for the sale of goods or services from customers of the financial service provider using their means of identification from the FSP (card or other). The merchant could be owned directly by the FSP or simply have access to a network enabling the merchant to process payments.\\n\\nOrganizations using an ‘other’ approach to delivering microfinance should describe the method or approach used.\\n\\nOrganizations can refer to the following resources for additional guidance:\\n\\n-Microfinance Information Exchange: Measuring the Performance of Alternative Delivery Channels (https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/about/what-we-do/mix)\\n\\n-International Finance Corporation: Digital Finance (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Industry_EXT_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Financial+Institutions/Priorities/Digital+Finance)',\n",

Repayment capacity analyses should be systematic and complete to ensure that lending decisions are based on an appropriate debt-to-income ratio.\\n\\nOrganizations should disclose the financial costs to borrowers for the most representative loan product, which closely tracks the cost clients carry. They should compare these costs with those of similar products offered to similar populations by other organizations in the same country or region.\\n\\nExamples of practices for repayment capacity analyses, to footnote, include, among others, relying on more information than just guarantees (whether peer guarantees, co-signature, or collateral), such as household surplus; taking into consideration the possibility of additional, undisclosed debt; disseminating the organization's repayment capacity policy among employees; uniformly applying the repayment capacity policy in practice; performing analyses at each loan cycle; and visiting clients to verify information. Organizations should also note whether they restructure products/services in cases where repayment is an issue.\\n\\nOrganizations can refer to the Smart Campaign (http://www.smartcampaign.org/storage/documents/avoidance.pdf) for further guidance on conducting repayment capacity analyses.\",\n",

Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. For further details on these measures and practical application in the investment context, see IADB’s \"The Use of Effective Coverage in the Evaluation of Maternal and Child Health Programs: A Technical Note for the IDB’s Social Protection and Health” (https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Use-of-Effective-Coverage-in-the-Evaluation-of-Maternal-and-Child-Health-Programs-A-Technical-Note-for-the-IDB-Social-Protection-and-Health-Division.pdf) and “Effective coverage as a new approach to health system performance assessment: a scoping review” (https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3692-7). For background on the measure itself, see “Access, utilization, quality, and effective coverage: an integrated conceptual framework and measurement strategy” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953604006070?via%3Dihub).\\n\\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact).

For external validation or verification, organizations should footnote which services were covered, the date of evaluation, and the entity conducting verification/validation (e.g., university researcher, consultant, ecosystem services bank).\\n\\nOrganizations can apply this metric in risk screening (‘which ecosystem services are at risk due to the investment?’), identifying restoration opportunities (‘which ecosystem services can benefit from an investment in restoration?’), and comparison (‘which product innovations or locations for restoration are most promising in terms of generating ecosystem services?’).\\n\\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Protected Land Area: Total (PI4716), Protected Land Area: Permanent (PI3924), Land Directly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (OI6912), Land Indirectly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (PI6796), Land Directly Controlled: Total (OI5408), and Land Indirectly Controlled: Total (PI3789).\\n\\nThe detailed options for this metric were sourced from the World Resources Institute (WRI).',\n",

Biodiversity and much of the global population face water shortages due to drying out of habitats, leading to drinking water shortages, salinization, and failed harvests. Knowledge of water stress levels can guide organizations’ design and focus of sustainable water management plans, including irrigation methods, urban planning, and wastewater reuse.\\n\\nOrganizations may use tools such as the Water Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) or WWF–DEG's Water Risk Filter (http://waterriskfilter.panda.org/) to find data on and describe water stress on directly or indirectly managed land. Remote sensing data are also a valuable source of information on water stress and its impact on ecosystems anywhere in the world; such data are often available at small spatial scale, if needed.\\n\\nThis metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, refer to the IRIS+ guidance document: IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact. No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

Organizations may use this metric to disaggregate Water Discharged (OD0386) by volume of water treated. For sanitation-related investments, organizations should disaggregate and apply this calculation specifically to wastewater. \\n\\nTreating water aims to improve water’s quality to make it more acceptable for an end-use, such as drinking, industry, or safe return to the environment, by removing or reducing existing water contaminants. Increasing population pressure is increasing the amount of wastewater. Untreated effluent is discharged to water bodies and terrestrial ecosystems, leading to nutrient surpluses (which can cause anoxic conditions and species loss) and the presence of toxic, often non-degradable compounds in ecosystems. Untreated wastewater contains pathogens that can contaminate drinking water. Treating and recycling polluted water can help tackle water shortages.\\n\\nMinimum requirements for treatment might be specified by national, sub-national, or local legislation; in setting treatment levels, however, organizations should consider the impacts of their overall water discharge and the needs of other water users. For further guidance on treatment requirements, see SDG 6: Progress on Wastewater Treatment (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275967/9789241514897-eng.pdf?ua=1).',\n",

For example, when applied to Client Organizations (PI9652), this disaggregation would capture the number of client organizations founded by members of the selected demographic group(s).\\n\\nFounders should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.\",\n",

Organizations should apply this metric to a metric or set of metrics that defines the relevant set of target stakeholders. For example, some organizations might report Client Households: Total (PI7954), disaggregated by relevant options from Target Stakeholder Demographics (PD5752). Other organizations with a different target stakeholder might instead apply this metric to Supplier Individuals: Total (PI5350).\\n\\nThis indicator is based on and refers to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) developed by FAO’s Voices of the Hungry Project. The FIES is an experience-based measure of food insecurity severity that relies on people’s direct responses to questions about their experiences facing constrained access to food. The FIES can be used to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity at different levels of severity, which is key information for implementing policies that aim to realize the human right to food. The FIES Survey Module (FIES-SM) comprises eight questions regarding people's access to adequate food and can be easily integrated into various types of surveys. For more on FIES, including the questions translated into over 170 languages, link to SDG 2.1.2, and free data analysis tools, see FAO’s FIES website (https://www.fao.org/in-action/voices-of-the-hungry/background/en/).
