    "After a couple of Kaggle competitions, I get the general idea of building and training a model. Now I should revise the NLP stuff from the book (as well as the excersises) and perhaps do a NLP course.\n",

    "## Here's what chatgpt told me to do:\n",

    "I'm glad to hear you've successfully completed the Titanic and House Prices competitions on Kaggle! These are excellent introductory competitions that cover fundamental concepts in data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you've expressed interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the \"working with text\" tutorial from scikit-learn would indeed be a good next step. There are also several NLP competitions on Kaggle that you might find interesting, such as the [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) or the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from NLP, here are some other subdomains in data science that you might consider exploring:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time Series Analysis:** This involves working with data that is collected over time to predict future points in the series. Kaggle has a competition called [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) which involves forecasting sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Processing/Computer Vision:** This domain involves tasks like object detection, image recognition, and segmentation. You might find competitions like [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) (a beginner-friendly competition) or [Severstal: Steel Defect Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection) interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anomaly Detection:** This involves identifying unusual data points in your dataset. Kaggle's [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset could be a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendation Systems:** This involves suggesting products to users based on their past behavior. Check out the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset for a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deep Learning:** While not a subdomain per se, deep learning techniques are incredibly important in modern data science and can be applied to many of the above domains. The [TensorFlow 2.0 Question and Answering competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering) is an excellent opportunity to get hands-on with deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, one of the most important aspects of learning data science is working on projects that interest you. So, while it's good to get a broad base of knowledge, be sure to spend some time delving deeper into the areas that you find most engaging. Happy learning!"
