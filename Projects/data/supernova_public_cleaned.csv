We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by the middle of the decade through energy effciency work and reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases 100 percent of the time. Reducing value chain emissions By 2030, we will reduce our emissions_scope_3 by more than half from a 2020 baseline."
