# Johannes's Portfolio Website

Here are the foundations of [johannes.vc](https://johannes.vc).

## Concept

After a career consisting of mainly reading and writing, it felt at first concerning my entire body of work is just a few megabytes. Seen through the lense of Big Data, my life work seemed miniscule. But it was a perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with NLP tools and techniques, as I was able to effectively evaluate various outputs.

## Process

My journey began with conventional NLP methods, clustering texts into topics using LDA, Tf-idf, and exploring word and document vector representations. Eventually, I discovered that transformer-based vectors yielded the best results.

## Outcome: a Collection of *possible* Essays, Blogs and Articles

Feel free to visit [johannes.vc](https://johannes.vc) to interact with the writings. The 'blog' allows you to propose a topic, which then triggers a semantic search through my work, and rewrites what I have written on the topic. It also features a "universe" of topic clusters. Selecting a cluster first generates a topic description. You can then generate, again, a compilation based on the underlying texts. 

## Future Directions

The model is prompted to distinguish my texts from its additions. It doesn't always do this well. It gravitates towards certain formats losing substance in the process.

This project is a preliminary exploration in presenting writings in a novel non-linear way. Imagine people interacting with not only books but also people (based on correspondence or social media accounts) for ever. Why even produce a memoir if readers can engage with collections of notes as if they were customised to their interests?
