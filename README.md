# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

Here I present my journey in Data Science, Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in a collection of Jupyter Notebooks. They reflect my learning journey to turn data into insights. 

My motivations for sharing this repo are the following: 


## 1. My Data Science Journey: Delivering Impactful Insights

With the objective of providing **actionable insights** to Sustainable and Impact Investors, I expanded my toolkit. 

I became an expert in Python and many of its data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and many many more. 

Both in Jupyter Notebooks and on the cloud (GCP).


## 2. Motivating Data Enthusiasts and Showcasing My Skills

This repository narrates my growth in data science and analytics, intending to:

- Inspire data enthusiasts with real-world data transformations.
- Demonstrate my skills in machine learning and data analysis, focusing on data modeling and automation beyond traditional tools like Excel and Power BI. 


## 3. Leveraging Data Management and Cloud Technologies

This portfolio also includes several notebooks on *the Cloud*, such as: 

- API integration, database management, and cloud technologies (Google Cloud, SQL, MongoDB).
- Projects on data collection and conversion of unstructured data into structured formats (Python's many NLP libaries).
- And other ways to transform *big data* into actionable insights (interactive data viz, html tables, wordclouds).
